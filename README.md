# Cainii-si-Vulpea
It is a game for the discipline ,,Introduction to Programming,, made by me and my colleague. The game is about a fox and four hounds. We have a game board, where two people can play: one will be the fox and another - the hounds. The fox to win has to get to the other side of the board, but if she gets surrounded by hounds, then she loses.

**Technologies Used:** C++
